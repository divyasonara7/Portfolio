              In addition to my frontend skills, I also have a solid understanding of
              backend technologies such as Node.js and Golang. This knowledge allows me to
              create full-stack solutions that are optimized for performance and

              skills and creativity is essential for creating successful web projects, and
              I strive to bring both to every project I work on.
